This project is one of two parts to my final year project in college as an electronic engineer, the goal of my project was to design design and develop a drone flight control system with a Ground Control Station (GCS) for real-time monitoring and control. The system consists of two main components, the flight controller onboard the drone and the GCS on the ground. The flight controller utilizes an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to sense the drone's orientation and employs a control algorithm to maintain a user-defined orientation by adjusting the speed of the motors. The GCS provides a graphical user interface for the user to monitor the drone's orientation in real-time, modify desired orientation, adjust control parameters, record flight data, and analyse flight performance.

This repo implements the drone's flight controller it is specifically written to work on the "Arduino nano 33 BLE sense Rev 2". The system was tested on a custom made test rig and performed well, some issues arrose with the fact that the motors and esc being used waas not from the same manufacture, with one motor being around 10% stronger that the other, i compensated this by decreasng the base throttle of the strogger motor by 10%. This code should not be put to control a real drone for many reasons!! the first being it is an incomplete flight controller, the performance should be dramastically increased with more safegaurds put in place. I acknowledge that this is not a perfect project i will continue to work on this but i hope it can help someone.
